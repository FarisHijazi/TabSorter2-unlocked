TabSorter 2 - 2022  


### Why was TS2 removed
<!-- around March of 2020 - I got an email  -->
- Violation reference ID: Purple Potassium
<!-- - Violation: Requesting but not using the following permission(s):  
<pre>
  - downloads           (used by: saving all tabs)
  - management         (used in initalizing OnInstall/Uninstall API event, the variables defined there are used globally in many other functionalities)
  - notifications       (used by: Tab Alert after a set time)
  - system.display     (used for multiscreen support)
</pre>
 -->
  
### Why isn't it back yet?
<!-- finding workaround for some of the features took much longer than excepted... and then covid... -->


### What are the future plans?

- #### Mannifest Version 3 

 - #### implementation and limitation over Mv2
<!-- Mv2 is being IMO prematurely pushed aside to make way for [Mv3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/)
Given than the last release of TabSorter2 was still under Manifest v2 and was removed for having permissions -->
